	<p> A Florida native prone to sunburns, I knew from a young age that I would leave the state as soon as I could.  My journey took me to The George Washington University, where Shakespeare and Marcuse taught me I had no interest in working for the government.</p>  

	<p>I started my professional life in edtech by way of a human resources internship with <a href="http://2u.com/">an amazing company called 2U</a>.  While researching HR and project management applications, I realized I had endless ideas and strong opinions about the user experience I wanted for my team.</p> 

	<p>A designer by nature but not by training, I turned to Startup Institute.</p>

	<p>That's where you'll find me until December 18, 2013. </p>
