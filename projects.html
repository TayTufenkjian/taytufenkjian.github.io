				<h2>If timesheets were beautiful</h2>
				<p>I can trace my passion for digital design to a particular moment in personal history.  I was an HR analyst sitting through demo after demo of systems we were considering implementing.  I hated all of them.  Why couldn't enterprise systems be as beautiful and intuitive as social networks or gaming apps?</p>

				<p>If I were to build an internal business system, it would look like this. And yes, it would actually be <em>one</em> system.</p>
